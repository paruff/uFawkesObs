Unit tests for OpenTelemetry Collector configuration validation.

These tests validate the OTel Collector configuration to ensure:
- Valid YAML syntax
- Required receivers are defined
- Processor pipeline order is logical
- Exporters have valid endpoints
- Resource attributes schema is correct
- Common misconfigurations are caught
