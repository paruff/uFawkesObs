# Grafana Dashboards Documentation

This document describes the pre-built Grafana dashboards included in the uFawkesObs observability platform.

## Overview

uFawkesObs includes 4 pre-built dashboards that provide comprehensive monitoring across the entire observability stack:

1. **Observability Stack Health** - Monitor the health of core observability components
2. **IoT Devices & MQTT** - Monitor IoT device connectivity and MQTT broker
3. **Application Performance** - Monitor application RED metrics and traces
4. **Infrastructure Overview** - Monitor container and host resources

All dashboards are:

- ✅ Auto-provisioned on startup
- ✅ Stored in version control
- ✅ Pre-configured with variables for filtering
- ✅ Set to auto-refresh every 30 seconds
- ✅ Configured with 1-hour default time range

## Using the Dashboards

### Accessing Dashboards

1. Open Grafana at http://localhost:3000
2. Login with credentials: `admin` / `admin`
3. Click on **Dashboards** in the left menu
4. All 5 dashboards will be available in the list

### Using Dashboard Variables

Most dashboards include variables for filtering data:

- **Time Range Variables** - Select preset time ranges (15m, 1h, 6h, etc.)
- **Service/Container Variables** - Filter by specific service or container
- **Topic Variables** - Filter MQTT topics in IoT dashboard

Variables appear at the top of each dashboard and update all panels when changed.

### Auto-Refresh

All dashboards are configured to auto-refresh every 30 seconds to show near real-time data.

To change the refresh interval:

1. Click the refresh icon in the top-right
2. Select a different interval or turn off auto-refresh

### Time Range Selection

Default time range is **1 hour** (`now-1h` to `now`).

To change the time range:

1. Click the time range selector in the top-right
2. Select a preset range or enter a custom range

---

## Dashboard Provisioning

Dashboards are automatically provisioned on Grafana startup via the provisioning configuration.

**Provisioning Config:** `config/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yaml`

```yaml
apiVersion: 1

providers:
  - name: "default"
    orgId: 1
    folder: ""
    type: file
    disableDeletion: false
    updateIntervalSeconds: 10
    allowUiUpdates: false
    options:
      path: /var/lib/grafana/dashboards
      foldersFromFilesStructure: true
```

**Key Settings:**

- `disableDeletion: false` - Dashboards can be deleted from UI (but will be re-provisioned on restart)
- `allowUiUpdates: false` - UI changes are not persisted (GitOps-first approach)
- `updateIntervalSeconds: 10` - Check for dashboard updates every 10 seconds

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboards Not Appearing

1. **Check Grafana logs:**

   ```bash
   docker compose logs grafana | grep -i dashboard
   ```

2. **Verify dashboard files exist:**

   ```bash
   ls -la config/grafana/dashboards/
   ```

3. **Check provisioning config:**
   ```bash
   cat config/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboards.yaml
   ```

### No Data in Panels

1. **Check datasource connection:**

   - Go to Configuration → Data Sources
   - Verify Prometheus, Tempo, and Loki are connected

2. **Check metrics are being scraped:**

   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/targets
   ```

3. **Verify time range:**
   - Ensure the selected time range has data
   - Try expanding to "Last 24 hours"

### Panels Show "No Data"

This can happen when:

- Metrics don't exist yet (e.g., no MQTT traffic)
- Metric names have changed
- Service is not running or not being scraped

**Solutions:**

1. Start the missing service
2. Wait for at least one scrape cycle (30 seconds)
3. Check Prometheus targets are up: http://localhost:9090/targets

## Testing Dashboards

Run the integration tests to validate all dashboards:

```bash
# Start the stack
docker compose --profile core up -d

# Wait for services to be ready
sleep 30

# Run dashboard tests
pytest tests/integration/test_dashboards.py -v
```

**Expected Output:**

```
✅ Grafana is ready after 3 attempts
✅ All 4 dashboards are provisioned
✅ Observability Stack Health dashboard validated
✅ IoT Devices & MQTT dashboard validated
✅ Application Performance dashboard validated
✅ Infrastructure Overview dashboard validated
✅ All dashboards have auto-refresh configured
✅ All dashboards have time range configured
✅ Prometheus datasource is configured correctly
✅ Tempo datasource is configured correctly
✅ Loki datasource is configured correctly
```

---

## Customizing Dashboards

While the dashboards are pre-built and version-controlled, you can:

1. **Make temporary changes in Grafana UI:**

   - Changes are not persisted (due to `allowUiUpdates: false`)
   - Useful for testing new panels or queries

2. **Create custom dashboards:**

   - Create new dashboards in Grafana UI
   - These won't be version controlled
   - Store in a different folder to avoid conflicts

3. **Modify dashboard JSON files:**
   - Edit files in `config/grafana/dashboards/`
   - Restart Grafana to apply changes
   - Commit to version control

**Recommended Workflow:**

1. Test changes in Grafana UI
2. Export dashboard JSON
3. Update the file in `config/grafana/dashboards/`
4. Commit to git
5. Restart Grafana to verify

---

## Next Steps

- **Add custom panels** for your specific use case
- **Create alerts** based on dashboard metrics
- **Export dashboards** to share with team
- **Link dashboards** together for easy navigation
- **Add annotations** to mark deployments or incidents
